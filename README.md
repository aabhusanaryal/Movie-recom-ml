# Avana Internship - Task 3

## Hosting ML Model

### Acknoledgements

The model was taken from https://github.com/dis-is-pj/Movie-Recommender-System and was converted into a REST API which is hosted at my own VPS: https://movie-recom.aabhusanaryal.com.np/recommend/

I also created a frontend in Vue that calls the API and retreived suggestion for movies based on a given movie.

I also made the use of API from themoviedb.org to fetch more details about movies, such as it's ratings, excerpt, genres, etc.
